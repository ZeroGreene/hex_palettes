Here’s a **useful hex color palette** you can use if you want to represent the **Star Sapphire Corps (Violet/Pink Lanterns)** from DC Comics (the emotional spectrum corps representing *love*) — including both canonical *violet* tones and more stylized pink/purple variations often seen in comics and fan art.

### 🎨 Star Sapphire Corps — Hex Color Palette

> These colors are inspired by the *Star Sapphire Corps’s* emotional spectrum association with **violet (love)** and how they’re often depicted in comics (ranging from violet to magenta / pinkish-purple constructs).

| Name                             | Hex       | Notes                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Violet Core Base**             | `#8A2BE2` | Classic violet / purple family hue (Lantern-like)        |
| **True Violet (Lantern Energy)** | `#6A0DAD` | Deep violet suitable for core constructs/energy          |
| **Magenta / Passion Hue**        | `#D7008F` | Brighter “love” accent color often seen in comic effects |
| **Pinkish Energy Glow**          | `#FF4FCC` | Lighter neon/pink glow for soft highlights               |
| **Dark Violet Outline**          | `#4B0082` | Strong dark violet for shadows/edges                     |
| **Light Violet Glow**            | `#C77AFF` | Soft violet light for aura / ethereal effects            |

💡 These hexes are *suggestive and stylized*, based on color theory for violet/pink tones commonly associated with Star Sapphires (there’s no *official* published hex code from DC). The corps is canonically described as a **violet/light-purple Lantern Corps** tied to *love* on the emotional spectrum. ([DC Database][1])

### 📌 Comic vs. Gemstone Reference

Comic panels vary widely: artists sometimes make Star Sapphire constructs appear more **pink/magenta** than true violet, which is why you’ll see both violet-leaning and pink-leaning palettes in fan interpretations. ([Reddit][2])

If you want a **Star Sapphire gemstone reference** (outside comics) for inspiration:

* Typical *star sapphire gemstone* hex: **#386192** (a deep sapphire blue) — but this isn’t what the Lantern Corps uses visually in comics. ([Color Hex Map][3])

### 🛠 How to Use the Palette

* **Primary lantern glow/constructs:** `#6A0DAD`, `#D7008F`
* **Highlights / softer love energy:** `#FF4FCC`, `#C77AFF`
* **Shadows / outlines:** `#4B0082`
* **Accent / secondary energy:** `#8A2BE2`
